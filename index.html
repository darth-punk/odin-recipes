      Lasagna is a classic Italian dish of wide, flat pasta sheets layered with
      fillings and baked until the cheese melts. The word "lasagna" may come
      from the Latin word lasanum, which means "cooking pot" or "chamber pot",
      or from the Greek flatbread laganon. The dish is named after its
      labor-intensive preparation method and is considered one of the oldest
      pasta dishes in Italian cuisine.
